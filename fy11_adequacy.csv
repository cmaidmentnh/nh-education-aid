(1)  Process for returning Statewide Education Property Tax (SWEPT) to the State:  If the SWEPT raised by a municipality is greater,,,,,,,,,,
"than the Calculated Cost of Adequacy, the municipality may be required to return excess SWEPT.  This will be determined by the",,,,,,,,,,
Department of Revenue Administration when tax rates are set for the 10-11 school year.  If the total new tax revenue needed to ,,,,,,,,,,
"cover the 10-11 school budget is less than the amount that will be raised by the SWEPT, then the SWEPT will be used to cover",,,,,,,,,,
"the budget, the local school tax rate will be set at $0.00, and any SWEPT not used will be remitted to the State.",,,,,,,,,,
